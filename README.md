# Traffic-Lights4

You need to develop a traffic light system with your own logics  

Detailed description:
 4 side lights( like a chowk)

Use Start Button to start flow and stop button to stop

 1)First light would be green for 5 seconds and the rest 3 lights would be red (i.e 2nd, 3rd and 4th lights)
 After 5 seconds the first light would be yellow for 1 second and after 1 second it would be Red. 
 

 When 1st light would be red then 2nd light would be green for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, 2nd light would be yellow for 1 second

Same process will go for all 4 lights. 

When you click stop, it will stop the flow.
